Sway is a collaborative project between myself and Audrey Levy, an IDEO minted industrial designer. After spending a summer in New York City, I started craving an easy to use application that simply tells me when my trains are arriving. Sure Google Maps works, but I found it redundant to specify where I'm going every time I open the app. Sway saves your home and work stations, and uses your geolocation to fetch proper train times. Open the app. Get the times.
